## 🚀 Installation via Chrome Web Store

<a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/clean-mode-toggle/cfffoplaiopgipdajmkdagiccnglehgm">
  <img src="images/chrome_web_store.png" alt="Install from Chrome Web Store" width="210"/>
</a>

- Option 1: Install directly from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/clean-mode-toggle/cfffoplaiopgipdajmkdagiccnglehgm)
- Option 2: Download this repository and load it as an unpacked extension in Chrome.

## 🔥 Usage 

Clicking on the extension icon is hiding / showing all pinned chrome extensions. In the Options, you can permanently exclude specific extensions.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ⚠️ **This addon is not hiding, it's actually (de)activating the extensions**  
> 👉 This is because Google Chrome doesn't have an API to hide/show extensions
